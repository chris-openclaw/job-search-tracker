# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this skill adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Data Handling and Privacy** section clarifying that the skill is instruction-only, stores all data locally in the user's working directory, makes no external network calls of its own, uses no telemetry, and gates all writes from Gmail/LinkedIn behind explicit user confirmation

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Resume Recommender**: reads resume variants from a `resumes/` directory and matches each variant's self-description against new job postings to suggest the best fit
- **Tone Check** pass on user-drafted emails and cover letters with flag categories for desperate signals, templated signals, negative framing, and length issues; produces targeted phrase-level revision suggestions rather than full rewrites
- **Salary Negotiation** flow triggered on "got an offer" with offer triage, counter-offer analysis (gap to target, which components have room), counter-offer drafting, and pressure-tactic flagging (exploding offers, verbal-only, below-range, total-comp framing)
- Three new Common Workflows: "I got an offer," "Which resume should I send?," and "Does this sound desperate?"

### Changed
- Frontmatter now includes `version` and `metadata.openclaw.emoji` fields
- Trigger description expanded to cover offer, negotiation, resume, and tone-check phrases

### Removed
- License section removed from README (license now managed at the ClawHub platform level)
